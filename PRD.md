# AI Agent Bridge - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

The AI Agent Bridge is a standalone server and Go SDK that provides a secure, zero-trust communication layer between control-plane systems and AI agent processes running on local or remote machines.

It enables two primary consumers to orchestrate AI agents:

- **prd-manager-control-plane** - A Go HTTP API server that manages PRD projects, sessions, and agent workflows via Slack and CLI interfaces. Currently manages agent subprocesses in-process (via `internal/agent/Manager`).
- **ndara-ai-orchestrator** - A Go gRPC-based orchestrator that coordinates repo-level AI agents across machines using mTLS + JWT authentication. Dispatches tasks and streams events from agent daemons.

The bridge replaces direct in-process agent management with a networked, provider-agnostic daemon boundary that both projects can integrate via a shared Go SDK.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

1. **prd-manager-control-plane** manages agent subprocesses in-process (`exec.CommandContext`). Agent crashes can crash the API server. There is no reconnect/replay for event streams, no multi-provider support, and no remote agent capability.

2. **ndara-ai-orchestrator** has a well-designed gRPC + mTLS architecture for remote agent daemons, but the agent daemon (`agentd`) is a stub that does not actually supervise AI agent processes. It lacks provider adapters (codex, claude, opencode) and subprocess lifecycle management.

3. Neither project has a shared, reusable agent bridge. Each would need to independently solve agent subprocess management, provider abstraction, event streaming, and security.

### What the Bridge Solves

- **Failure isolation**: Agent crashes do not crash the control-plane processes.
- **Reconnect/replay**: Event streams support sequence-based resume.
- **Provider abstraction**: Codex, Claude, and OpenCode behind a single gRPC API.
- **Local + remote agents**: Same protocol for localhost and cross-network agents.
- **Zero-trust security**: Per-project CAs with cross-signing, mTLS, and short-lived JWTs.
- **Shared infrastructure**: One implementation, two consumers, consistent behavior.

---

## 3. Goals

- Provide a standalone bridge daemon that supervises AI agent subprocess lifecycles.
- Expose a gRPC API for session management, command routing, and event streaming.
- Support codex, claude, and opencode providers at launch.
- Implement zero-trust security using per-project CAs with cross-signing, mTLS, and JWTs.
- Support both local and remote agent communication from day one.
- Ship a Go SDK (`bridgeclient`) for integration by consumer projects.
- Provide durable per-session pub/sub replay so SDK clients can reconnect and receive events they missed while disconnected (while bridge process is alive).
- Provide a CLI tool for CA/cert management (`ai-agent-bridge-ca`).

---

## 4. Non-Goals

- Web UI or dashboard (consumers provide their own).
- Persistent event storage (in-memory ring buffer only; consumers can persist if needed).
- AI model routing or selection (consumers decide which provider to use).
- Acting as a CI/CD system.
- SDKs for languages other than Go and Node.js (protobuf definitions available for future stub generation).

---

## 5. Users

- **prd-manager-control-plane** - Integrates via Go SDK to replace `internal/agent/Manager` with bridge-backed agent sessions.
- **ndara-ai-orchestrator** - Integrates via Go SDK to add real agent subprocess management behind its existing `AgentDaemon` gRPC service.
- **Web Application Developers** - Use `packages/bridge-client-node` and the `useBridgeSession` React hook to embed agent sessions in browser-based UIs without needing to speak gRPC directly.
- **DevOps/Platform Engineers** - Deploy and operate bridge daemons on agent host machines.
- **Security Engineers** - Configure and audit the zero-trust PKI infrastructure.

### 6.2 Operational Modes

The bridge ships two distinct runtime binaries with different assumptions, startup behaviours, and intended operators. Understanding this separation is fundamental to deploying and integrating the system correctly.

#### Local Server (`bridgectl server start`)

The local server is a developer-facing tool for managing AI agent sessions on a machine where the agent CLIs are already installed and configured through their **native interfaces** (e.g. `claude` authenticated via `claude auth login`, `codex` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the shell environment).

| Property | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Binary | `cmd/bridgectl` |
| Startup validation | Binary existence and executability only — no API key checks |
| Credential source | Inherits the operator's existing shell environment |
| Transport security | Optional — defaults to plain gRPC on localhost |
| Intended operator | Developer or local user who has already configured their AI agents natively |
| Typical use | Local development, ad-hoc sessions, testing bridge plumbing without production infrastructure |

**Key assumption**: the developer has already authenticated each provider CLI using that provider's own tooling. The bridge does not manage or validate credentials; it simply launches the CLIs that are already ready to run.

**What the local server manages**: session lifecycle (start, stop, event streaming, reconnect), provider multiplexing, and the gRPC API surface — not credential provisioning.

#### Daemon (`bridge` / `cmd/bridge`)

The daemon is a production-grade service designed to run headlessly on a server or agent host. External systems (prd-manager-control-plane, ndara-ai-orchestrator, web clients) connect to it remotely over mTLS + JWT. It is expected to operate without user intervention after initial provisioning.

| Property | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Binary | `cmd/bridge` |
| Startup validation | Calls `config.ValidateProviderEnv()` and `p.ValidateStartup()` — validates required API keys are present before accepting connections |
| Credential source | `/etc/ai-agent-bridge/agents.env` injected at service startup (e.g. via systemd drop-in) |
| Transport security | Required — mTLS + JWT enforced; no plain connections |
| Intended operator | DevOps / platform engineer provisioning a persistent agent host |
| Typical use | Production deployments, ai-desktops hosts, headless CI/CD agents, integration target for control-plane services |

**Key assumption**: all required API keys are provisioned before the daemon starts. If a configured provider is missing its credentials, the daemon refuses to start rather than failing later at session time.

**What the daemon manages**: everything the local server manages, plus zero-trust PKI, rate limiting, audit logging, systemd lifecycle, and the expectation of continuous uptime.

#### Mode Comparison

```
               Local Server (bridgectl)          Daemon (bridge)
               ─────────────────────────         ─────────────────────────
Operator       Developer                         DevOps / platform team
Setup          Native CLI auth already done      API keys in agents.env
Key check      At session launch (by the CLI)    At daemon startup
Transport      Plain gRPC (localhost default)    mTLS + JWT (required)
Auth           None (localhost only)             Per-project CAs + short-lived JWTs
Deployment     Foreground process / dev tool     systemd service
External conn  Not intended                      Primary purpose
```

## 7. Security Model: Zero-Trust PKI

### 7.1 Trust Architecture

Each project (prd-manager, ndara-orchestrator, ai-agent-bridge) operates its own Certificate Authority. Trust between projects is established through cross-signing.

```
Project A CA                    Project B CA
    │                               │
    ├── Project A server cert       ├── Project B server cert
    ├── Project A client cert       ├── Project B client cert
    │                               │
    └── Cross-signs Project B CA ◄──┘
        (and vice versa)
```

### 7.2 Certificate Hierarchy

```
ai-agent-bridge-ca (root)
├── Bridge Server Certificate
│   └── SAN: bridge host FQDN/IP
├── Bridge Client Certificates (one per consumer)
│   ├── prd-manager client cert
│   └── ndara-orchestrator client cert
└── Cross-signed CA certificates
    ├── prd-manager CA (cross-signed by bridge CA)
    └── ndara-orchestrator CA (cross-signed by bridge CA)
```

### 7.3 Authentication Layers

**Layer 1: mTLS (Transport)**
- All gRPC connections require mutual TLS.
- Server presents a certificate signed by its project CA.
- Client presents a certificate signed by its project CA.
- Both sides verify against the cross-signed trust bundle.
- No `InsecureSkipVerify` anywhere.
- Minimum TLS 1.3.

**Layer 2: JWT (Application)**
- Every RPC call includes a short-lived JWT in gRPC metadata (`authorization: Bearer <token>`).
- JWTs are signed with Ed25519 keys (not HS256 shared secrets).
- Claims include: `sub` (caller identity), `project_id`, `aud` (bridge), `iat`, `exp`.
- TTL: 5 minutes maximum.
- Bridge verifies signature, expiry, audience, and issuer.

**Layer 3: Authorization (Policy)**
- Per-session authorization: caller must have `project_id` claim matching the session's project.
- `repo_path` validation: must be under a configured allowed-paths list.
- Per-project and global session limits enforced.
- Provider capability checks before session start.

### 7.4 Key Management

- Ed25519 keypairs for JWT signing (one per consumer project).
- RSA 4096 or ECDSA P-384 for TLS certificates.
- CA keys stored encrypted at rest (passphrase-protected PEM).
- Certificate rotation: certs expire after 90 days; automated renewal via `ai-agent-bridge-ca renew`.
- Revocation: CRL distribution point served by bridge daemon.

### 7.5 Defense in Depth

- Bridge binds to configurable interface (default: private/localhost).
- Rate limiting on session creation and command input.
- Input size limits (max command text size).
- Secret redaction in event streams and logs.
- Audit logging of all authentication and authorization decisions.
- No plaintext traffic under any configuration.

---

## 7.6 Debian/Ubuntu Distribution

The bridge must be installable on supported Ubuntu hosts through a signed apt repository so operators can install and upgrade it with standard package-management workflows instead of building from source.

### Packaging Scope

- Ship a Debian package named `ai-agent-bridge`.
- Initial supported targets:
  - Ubuntu `24.04` (`noble`) on `amd64`
  - Ubuntu `25.04` (`plucky`) on `amd64`
- Install package contents to conventional system locations:
  - `ai-agent-bridge` and `ai-agent-bridge-ca` binaries in `/usr/bin`
  - default config in `/etc/ai-agent-bridge/bridge.yaml`
  - systemd unit in `/lib/systemd/system/ai-agent-bridge.service`
- Provide a default packaged config that allows the daemon to start on a fresh host without bundled provider CLIs or API keys.
- Provider CLIs and their API credentials remain operator-managed prerequisites and must be documented separately from the package install flow.

### Publishing and Hosting

- Release automation must build `.deb` artifacts from release tags using the existing release workflow pattern.
- The apt repository must be published in a GitHub-hosted location with the full Debian repository structure (`dists/`, `pool/`, `Packages`, `Release`, `InRelease`).
- Repository metadata and packages must be signed with a GPG key stored in GitHub Actions secrets.
- Release artifacts must also be attached to the GitHub release for direct inspection/download.

### Installation Flow

- Provide an `install.sh` helper that:
  - installs the repository signing key into `/etc/apt/keyrings`
  - writes the apt source list entry
  - runs `apt-get update`
  - installs `ai-agent-bridge`
- Installation documentation must include both the helper-script path and the equivalent manual apt commands.

### Acceptance Criteria

- A release tag builds a signed `.deb` for each supported Ubuntu target.
- The published apt repository is consumable with standard `apt` commands on supported Ubuntu releases.
- A clean Ubuntu host can install `ai-agent-bridge`, start the systemd service, and pass a basic daemon health check.
- The release workflow includes smoke coverage that validates apt installation in containers and on an EC2 host.
- `README.md` and `docs/` describe package installation, runtime prerequisites, and service behavior accurately.

## 7.7 ai-desktops Agent-Host Deployment Target

The bridge must support a first-class deployment profile for the **ai-desktops** platform: Ubuntu 24.04 machines where the daemon runs as a system service and AI agents operate against repositories mounted under `/workspace`.

### Deployment Profile Requirements

- The package must ship a provider runtime installer (`install-provider-runtime`) that:
  - Verifies or installs Node.js at the required major version.
  - Installs pinned provider CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini) into `/opt/ai-agent-bridge` using `npm ci` with a staging directory pattern so a failed install never destroys a working runtime.
  - Reports installed CLI versions for operator verification.
- The package must ship an ai-desktops example config (`bridge-ai-desktops.yaml`) with correct provider stanzas for all four supported providers and `/workspace` included in `allowed_paths`.
- The package must ship a systemd drop-in example (`ai-desktops.conf`) that:
  - Injects provider API keys from `/etc/ai-agent-bridge/agents.env` at service startup.
  - Grants agent subprocesses write access to `/workspace`, `/var/lib/ai-agent-bridge`, `/tmp`, and `/var/tmp`.
- Provider API keys must be stored in `/etc/ai-agent-bridge/agents.env` with `root:root 0600` permissions and never written to disk by the bridge itself.
- The Node.js runtime validation must only run when at least one configured provider actually invokes Node.js (native binary providers such as OpenCode must not trigger Node validation).

### Supported Providers on ai-desktops

| Provider | Invocation | Required Credential |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `/usr/bin/node ... @anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Codex | `/usr/bin/node ... @openai/codex/bin/codex.js` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| OpenCode | `/opt/ai-agent-bridge/node_modules/.bin/opencode` (native binary) | `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Gemini CLI | `/usr/bin/node ... @google/gemini-cli/dist/index.js` | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |

### Acceptance Criteria

- `install-provider-runtime` installs all four provider CLIs and reports their versions on a clean Ubuntu 24.04 host with Node.js 24.
- A failed `npm ci` during runtime install does not remove a previously working `/opt/ai-agent-bridge/node_modules`.
- An apt profile smoke test verifies: package install, fixture provider registration, session start, `/workspace` access, echo round-trip, daemon restart, and health check — all without real API keys.
- The bridge daemon starts with an OpenCode (native binary) provider configured and does not trigger Node.js runtime validation.
- `docs/ai-desktops.md` provides a complete operator provisioning guide covering architecture, install, config, credentials, upgrade, and troubleshooting.

## 9. Provider Adapter Contract

### 9.1 Interface

```go
type Provider interface {
    ID() string
    Start(ctx context.Context, cfg SessionConfig) (SessionHandle, error)
    Send(handle SessionHandle, text string) error
    Stop(handle SessionHandle) error
    Events(handle SessionHandle) <-chan Event
    Health(ctx context.Context) error
}

type SessionConfig struct {
    ProjectID  string
    SessionID  string
    RepoPath   string
    Options    map[string]string
}

type SessionHandle interface {
    ID() string
    PID() int
}
```

### 9.2 Providers at Launch

| Provider | Binary | Communication | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `codex` | `codex` | stdio (stdin/stdout/stderr) | OpenAI Codex CLI |
| `claude` | `claude` | stdio (stdin/stdout/stderr) | Anthropic Claude CLI |
| `opencode` | `opencode` | stdio (stdin/stdout/stderr) | OpenCode CLI |

Each adapter:
- Spawns the provider binary as a child process.
- Pipes stdin for input, reads stdout/stderr for events.
- Monitors process health (PID alive check).
- Handles graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after timeout).
- Reports provider availability via `Health()`.

---

## 10. Event Model

### 10.1 Event Envelope

```go
type Event struct {
    Seq       uint64    // monotonic per session
    Timestamp time.Time
    ProjectID string
    SessionID string
    Provider  string
    Type      EventType
    Stream    string    // "system", "stdout", "stderr"
    Text      string
    Done      bool
    Error     string
}
```

### 10.2 Ring Buffer

- Bounded ring buffer per session (default: 10,000 events).
- When buffer is full, oldest events are dropped and a `BUFFER_OVERFLOW` event is emitted.
- `StreamEvents` with `after_seq` replays from buffer, then switches to live streaming.
- Buffer is released when session is removed (after stop + configurable retention period).

### 10.3 Durable SDK Replay Requirement

- The bridge must maintain a per-session outbound event queue that continues to enqueue agent events even when no SDK stream is connected.
- Delivery semantics are at-least-once per `(project_id, session_id, subscriber_id)`.
- The SDK must identify itself with a stable `subscriber_id` and resume using last acknowledged sequence.
- On reconnect, the bridge replays all queued events with `seq > ack_seq` in order, then switches to live tailing.
- If queued events exceed retention capacity, bridge emits `BUFFER_OVERFLOW` and resumes from the earliest retained sequence.
- Scope: guaranteed replay is required while the bridge daemon remains running and session is active; restart durability remains out of scope for this phase.

---

## 11. Go SDK (`bridgeclient`)

### 11.1 Package Structure

```
pkg/bridgeclient/

├── auth.go            // mTLS + JWT credential setup
└── errors.go          // Typed errors

### 11.3 Built-in Resilience

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures.
- JWT auto-renewal before expiry.
- Connection keepalive and health checking.
- Configurable timeouts per operation.
- Subscriber cursor tracking (`subscriber_id`, `ack_seq`) for reconnect + missed-event replay.

## 14. Integration Plans

### 14.1 prd-manager-control-plane Integration

**Current state**: `internal/agent/Manager` directly spawns agent subprocesses via `exec.CommandContext`. Events are emitted in-process via callback.

**Target state**: Replace `agent.Manager` usage in `httpapi/server.go` with `bridgeclient.Client`. The bridge client connects to a bridge daemon (local or remote) over gRPC+mTLS+JWT.

Changes required:
1. Add `pkg/bridgeclient` as a Go module dependency.
2. Add bridge configuration to server config (`bridge_target`, cert paths, JWT key path).
3. Replace `s.agentManager.Start(...)` calls with `bridgeClient.StartSession(...)`.
4. Replace `s.agentManager.Send(...)` calls with `bridgeClient.SendInput(...)`.
5. Replace `s.agentManager.Stop(...)` calls with `bridgeClient.StopSession(...)`.
6. Replace `s.agentManager.SetEventHandler(...)` with a goroutine calling `bridgeClient.StreamEvents(...)` and forwarding events to the existing `onAgentEvent` handler.
7. Add `provider` field to session-related API requests.
8. Keep existing Slack/CLI fan-out logic unchanged.

### 14.2 ndara-ai-orchestrator Integration

**Current state**: `agentd` implements the `AgentDaemon` gRPC service with stub handlers. `RunTask` logs the request but does not actually execute agent tasks. `StreamEvents` sends hardcoded demo events.

**Target state**: `agentd` uses `bridgeclient.Client` to connect to a local or remote bridge daemon. `RunTask` maps to `StartSession` + `SendInput`. `StreamEvents` maps to bridge `StreamEvents`.

Changes required:
1. Add `pkg/bridgeclient` as a Go module dependency.
2. In `agentd/main.go`, create a `bridgeclient.Client` connected to the local bridge daemon.
3. `RunTask` handler: call `bridgeClient.StartSession(...)` with the task's repo context, then `bridgeClient.SendInput(...)` with the task text.
4. `StreamEvents` handler: proxy `bridgeClient.StreamEvents(...)` to the caller, mapping bridge events to the existing `orch.v1.Event` protobuf.
5. `CancelRun` handler: call `bridgeClient.StopSession(...)`.
6. Reuse existing mTLS + JWT auth layers (the bridge has its own independent auth; `agentd` authenticates to the bridge as a separate trust boundary).

---

## 15. Success Criteria

1. Both consumer projects can start, command, and stop codex/claude/opencode sessions through the bridge.
2. Agent subprocess crashes do not affect the bridge daemon or consumer processes.
3. Event streams support reconnect/replay via sequence offsets.
4. All communication is encrypted with mTLS; all operations require valid JWTs.
5. Cross-signed CA trust enables secure communication between independently managed projects.
6. Session limits and policy guards are enforced.
7. Provider unavailability is detected and reported gracefully.
8. SDK reconnect receives all unseen queued session events in order (or explicit overflow signal if retention is exceeded).

---

## 16. Future Scope (Deferred)

- Additional providers: `gemini`, `droid`
- Persistent event storage (SQLite backend)
- SDKs for Python, TypeScript (generated from protobuf)
- SPIFFE/SPIRE integration for workload identity
- Web UI for bridge status and session management
- CRL/OCSP for real-time certificate revocation
- Multi-bridge clustering and session migration
- Policy-as-code (OPA/Rego) for authorization decisions
